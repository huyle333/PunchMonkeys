# PunchMonkeys
Punch Monkeys - Punch a virtual keyboard with your fists!

This is a project to explore if we can use Microsoft HoloLens to 
create a new way for programmers to type things into a computer. 
Insteading of sitting on a chair and typing, we want to test if we can
get programmers standup and punch a virtual keyboard in their virtual view. 

So programmers can get some excercises while working!
