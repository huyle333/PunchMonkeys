# PunchMonkeys
Punch Monkeys - Punch a virtual keyboard with your fists!

### About
This is a project to explore if we can use Microsoft HoloLens and Leap Motion
to create a new way for programmers to type things into a computer.
Instead of sitting on a chair and typing all day, we want to test if we can
get programmers standup and punch a virtual keyboard in their virtual view.

Programmers can load a file, punch the keys on the keyboard, and save!

### Development Environment

### Results

Originally, we wanted to implement the usage of the HoloLens to be able to rotate your head and see windows on the wall while you're punching, but we didn't get that far.

- Currently, you can plug in a Leap Motion Controller to your computer as long as you have the Leap Motion Controller software installed.
- You can open up Unity and open this project and double-click the "MainScene."
- You can hit the Play button at the top, load a file, start punching the keys in front of you, and type while exercising!
- Don't forget to save the file!
